### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ˜„ I am an idealistic Internet practitioner. I want to build great products. <br/>
- ðŸ’¬ I work as a product manager, and believe that technology is productivity. <br/>
- ðŸ¤” Maybe I can't be the greatest developer in this world, but I hope I can integrate resources to create the best product that can help everyone... <br/>
- ðŸš© I am trying to become an independent developer.
